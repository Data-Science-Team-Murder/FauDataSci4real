#Introduction. 

The current project is an analysis of five selected cities across the years. These cities were selected based on a follow-up article of our original FiveThirtyEight data. Published in july 2017, this article provided the cities with the highest and the lowest changes from 2016 to mid-year 2017. We wondered whether these cities presented a sudder change, or if they were slowly changing into such results. 

In a follow up article, the murder rates from 2017 across the US are compared to the murder rates from the 1990s. The article explains that while the murder rates have seen an overall increase over the past few years (since 2014), they are not nearly as high as in the 1990s. Another interesting point that was made is that there is evidence that shows that when a city's murder rate increases, the national average of murder rates seems to counteract or account for this by showing a decrease. 

Big cities also tend to skew the average murder rates in the US. 
The second half of the year, murders

# Understanding the FiveThirtyEight Data
  We run a multiple linear regression matrix to get a better sense of the data 
```{r EDA with ggpairs}
data(murder15)

ggpairs (murder15,
        lower = list(
            continuous = "smooth"),
        axisLabels ="none",
        switch = 'both',
        cardinality_threshold = 100)

data(murder16)
#str(murder15)

ggpairs (murder16,
        lower = list(
            continuous = "smooth"),
        axisLabels ="none",
        switch = 'both',
        cardinality_threshold = 100)

#We used this to display the list of states (rowss) and then We went through and wrote down the row numbers of the states that we are going to work with. The row numbers vary between the data sets we are using which is why it is important that we select the correct row numbers for each data set.

(FBIinc <- data.frame(Statesinc, year, murder))

```

we could not find the data by city across years, so we plot the states of each of the cities
```{r plotting states}

ggplot(FBIinc) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = Statesinc, color = Statesinc, group= size = 1.5)) + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Murders", title = "States Whose Cities Had the Largest Increase in Murder in Mid 2017", caption = "Source: https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/" )

ggplot(FBIdec) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = murder, group = Statesdec, color = Statesdec), size = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Murders", title = "States Whose Cities Had the Largest Decrease in Murder in Mid 2017", caption = "Source: https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/" )
